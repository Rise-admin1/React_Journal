                <p className='p-class'>
                    The publication process of an article is significantly influenced by the review process, which serves to improve the quality of manuscripts and aid editors in making decisions. Scientific Journals Portal employs a double-blind peer review system, which ensures anonymity for both authors and reviewers. This system eliminates any information that could potentially reveal the identity of the author(s) before sending the manuscript to the reviewers. Similarly, the identities of the reviewers are also kept hidden from the author(s) when their comments are shared. Scientific Journals Portal considers the double-blind peer review system to be more effective in reducing bias from either the selected reviewers or the authors.

                <p className='p-class'>
                    The initial phase of the review process occurs within the editorial office of Scientific Journals Portal. Upon submission, a manuscript undergoes an evaluation to ascertain its compliance with the journal’s minimum criteria before being forwarded to external reviewers. During this stage, the manuscript is assessed for the following aspects:
                </p>
            </div>
            <div className="">
                <h2 className='h2-class'>Possible Plagiarism</h2>
                <p className='p-class'>
                    The manuscript undergoes an assessment to determine its degree of resemblance to previously published works. In order to accomplish this objective, Scientific Journals Portal employs the iThenticate plagiarism detection system. Manuscripts that exhibit a significant level of similarity to other works, including those authored by the same individual(s), are not accepted during this phase. Authors are furnished with a report detailing the extent of similarity, along with the decision to reject the manuscript. Scientific Journals Portal is affiliated with SimilarityCheck, a program facilitated by iThenticate and initiated by Crossref, which aids its members in preventing instances of plagiarism.

                <p className='p-class'>
                    Once a manuscript has been assessed for similarity and deemed to be at an acceptable level, its content is then evaluated to ensure it aligns with the chosen journal’s scope. If the content does not align, the author(s) are contacted to obtain their consent for the manuscripts to be transferred to a more appropriate journal. However, it is important to note that a transferred manuscript does not guarantee acceptance in the receiving journal. The manuscript will still undergo the standard peer review process and may be accepted or rejected based on its suitability.

                <p className='p-class'>
                    Scientific Journals Portal strongly advocates for the inclusion of recent articles in citation. It is preferable that a substantial proportion of the cited articles are those published within the past five years. This holds particular significance for articles submitted to journals in the field of life sciences.

                <p className='p-class'>
                    Scientific Journals Portal currently exclusively publishes articles in English, while abstracts may be translated into other languages and published alongside the English abstract.Manuscripts undergo a thorough evaluation process to ensure adherence to the journal’s Instruction for Authors, focusing on structure, organisation, language correctness, and clarity. The editorial office typically makes minor grammatical corrections without altering the manuscript. However, if the language is significantly challenging to comprehend, the manuscript is returned to the author for improved clarity.Manuscripts that do not meet the initial review criteria are sent back to the author(s) for modification and resubmission. This initial review stage is crucial for authors to enhance their manuscripts at an early stage, and it is usually completed within a week. Upon successful completion of the editorial office review, the manuscript proceeds to the second stage. This stage employs a double-blind review system, where a minimum of two external reviewers with expertise in the subject area are selected from our database, editorial board, or other sources. Reviewers are invited to assess the manuscript based on its abstract, and if they accept, the full text is provided to them after the author(s) have been anonymized. Reviewers are responsible for assessing the manuscripts and providing constructive feedback to help the author(s) enhance the quality of the manuscript. Additionally, reviewers evaluate the manuscript based on its originality, contribution to the field, technical quality, clarity or presentations, and depth of research. Furthermore, reviewers offer one of the following recommendations regarding the manuscript:
                    <p>• Requires minor corrections.</p>
                    <p>• Requires moderate revision.</p>
                    <p>• Required major revision.</p>
                    <p>• Not suitable for further processing. In this case, the reviewer provides specific reason(s) why the manuscript should not be further processed.</p>
                    <p>It is important to note that even if a reviewer provides a positive report on a particular manuscript, if another reviewer raises concerns that could fundamentally undermine the study and its results, the manuscript may be rejected. Upon receiving the reviewers’ comments, the editorial office carefully reviews them. If the comments from the two reviewers significantly differ or contradict each other regarding the same manuscript, the manuscript is sent to a third reviewer for further evaluation. All reviewers’ comments including those from the third reviewer if necessary, are then forwarded to the author(s). The identities of the reviewers are kept confidential from the author(s). The duration of the second stage of the manuscript review process depends on the availability of the reviewers and typically ranges from one to four weeks. The author(s) of a manuscript use feedback from reviewers to make revisions and submit a new version for a final round of review. The editor of the journal then evaluates the original and revised manuscripts, along with all reviewer comments, and makes one of the following decisions:
                    </p>
                    <p>•Acceptance without changes.</p>
                    <p>• Acceptance with minor revisions.</p>
                    <p>• Required major revision.</p>
                    <p>• NRequest for major revisions</p>
                    <p>• Request for another round of review after revisions</p>
                    <p>• Rejection</p>
                    <p>Manuscripts that require revisions are returned to the author(s) for correction, and the editor reviews the revised version before making a final decision on publication. In some cases, the editor may request additional revisions or send the revised manuscript to a specific reviewer for further evaluation before making a final decision on publication.</p>
