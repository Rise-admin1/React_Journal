        <p className='p-class'>In order to become a member of the editorial board for a journal published by Scientific Journals Portal, individuals must have successfully completed a doctoral program. Additionally, the area of specialisation of the potential board member should align with the objectives and scope of the journal. Furthermore, applicants should possess research experience and have published works within their respective field of expertise. Moreover, editorial board members are expected to allocate sufficient time to promptly evaluate manuscripts that are assigned to them. Individuals interested in joining the editorial board are required to fill out the Editorial Board Application Form and include their most recent curriculum vitae. The editorial board undergoes regular evaluations, during which members may be requested to provide an updated version of their profile or resume. It is important to note that editors and members of the editorial board do not receive any form of compensation for their services. These roles are entirely voluntary in nature.
