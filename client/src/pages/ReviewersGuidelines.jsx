                <p className='text-justify mx-10'>The evaluation procedure or review is a significant component of the article publication process. It assists the editor in deciding on the suitability of an article and also provides the author with an opportunity to enhance the manuscript. Scientific Journals Portal employs a blind peer review system. Prior to agreeing to review a manuscript, reviewers should verify that:
                    <p>• The manuscript pertains to their field of expertise.</p>
                    <p>• They can allocate sufficient time to conduct a thorough evaluation of the manuscript.</p>

                <h2 className='h2-class'>Conflict of Interest</h2>
                <p className='p-class'>The existence of a conflict of interest (COI) arises when an individual’s private interests, which are in competition with their responsibilities to scientific and publishing activities, create a divergence. This divergence may lead a reasonable observer to question whether the individual’s behaviour or judgement was influenced by their competing interests.
                    The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) recommends that reviewers disclose any potential conflicts of interest and abstain from participating in the peer-review process if such conflicts exist.</p>

It is the responsibility of the reviewers to maintain the confidentiality of the review process. The manuscript and the review process details should be kept confidential both during and after the review process.</p>

The utilisation of information acquired during the peer-review process for personal or external gain, or to undermine or discredit others, is considered unethical by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE).
